# bash_programming
I love bash programming. I loved python and JavaScript but have fallen in love with the potential of the bash programming/scripting.
So, these are some of the projects I create in bash in my free time.

## Weather Reports
This is a small program that fetched weather data and lists the weather of the desired cities contained in a file. You can clone this 
repo and have more fun add new cities if you want.
